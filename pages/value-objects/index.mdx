# Value Objects

A value object is an immutable object that represents a concept or entity with a set of attributes, but has no unique identifier. The value of a value object is determined by its attributes, rather than by its identity. Value objects are often used to encapsulate and abstract complex data types, and can be used to improve the clarity, maintainability, and testability of code.
