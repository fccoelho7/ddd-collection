# Entities

Entities, central to Domain-Driven Design (DDD), represent core domain objects. Key characteristics:

1. **Identity**: Entities have a unique identity, usually represented by an identifier, setting them apart from others.

2. **Immutable**: Typically, entities are considered immutable after creation, although their state can change.

3. **Behavior**: Entities can perform actions and encapsulate specific rules and logic.

4. **Lifespan**: They exist, evolve, and eventually may be deleted or deactivated, tracked by their identity.

5. **Relationships**: Entities can relate to other entities, aiding in modeling complex domain scenarios.

6. **Persistence**: Entities often correspond to database records, with their identity used for mapping.

7. **Aggregates**: In DDD, entities are grouped into aggregates, clusters of related entities and value objects, treated as a single unit for data changes, promoting data consistency.

Entities provide a structured way to model core business concepts, fostering effective communication between developers and domain experts, and supporting complex software system design and implementation.

## Overview

```ts copy
class BaseEntity<T> {
  private id: T;

  constructor(id: T) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  get id(): T {
    return this.id;
  }
}

interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

class User extends BaseEntity<User> {
  private _name: string;
  private _email: Email;

  constructor(id: string, name: string, email: Email) {
    super(id);
    this._name = name;
    this._email = email;
  }

  get name(): string {
    return this._name;
  }

  set name(name: string) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  get email(): Email {
    return this._email;
  }

  set email(email: Email) {
    this._email = email;
  }

  // You can add more methods and behavior specific to the User entity.
}

// Example usage:
const user = new User("1", "John Doe", "john@example.com");
console.log(`User ID: ${user.id}`);
console.log(`User Name: ${user.name}`);
console.log(`User Email: ${user.email}`);
```
