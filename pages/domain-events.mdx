# Domain Events

Domain events capture significant state changes or occurrences in your software's domain. Key points:

- **Representation of Real-World Events:** They mirror real-world changes in your domain, preserving the history of what happened.

- **Immutable:** Domain events are typically unchangeable once created.

- **Decoupling:** They promote loose coupling between system components, enhancing maintainability.

- **Notification:** Domain events serve as a notification mechanism to inform other parts of the system about changes.

- **Log and Audit Trail:** They can be logged for auditing and historical record-keeping.

- **Event Sourcing:** Essential for event sourcing, where the entire system state is reconstructed by replaying events.

Common examples include events like "OrderPlaced" or "UserRegistered." They are implemented as event classes and dispatched by entities or aggregates to notify the system of important changes.

In summary, domain events play a vital role in DDD, allowing you to model and manage significant domain changes, foster loose coupling, and provide historical context for your system.

## Overview

```ts copy
import { EventEmitter } from "events";

// Step 1: Define the Abstract Domain Event
abstract class DomainEvent<T> {
  constructor(public data: T) {}
}

// Step 2: Create a Generic Event Emitter
class EventDispatcher {
  constructor(private eventEmitter: EventEmitter) {}

  // Step 3: Publish Domain Events
  publish<T>(event: DomainEvent<T>) {
    this.eventEmitter.emit(event.constructor.name, event);
  }

  // Step 4: Subscribe to Domain Events
  subscribe<T>(
    eventType: { new (...args: any[]): DomainEvent<T> },
    callback: (event: DomainEvent<T>) => void
  ) {
    this.eventEmitter.on(eventType.name, callback);
  }
}

// Step 5: Send Welcome Email
class EmailService {
  sendWelcomeEmail(userEmail: string) {
    // Implement your email sending logic here
    console.log(`Sending a welcome email to: ${userEmail}`);
  }
}

// Usage
const eventDispatcher = new EventDispatcher(eventEmitter);
const emailService = new EmailService();

// Define specific event types for user creation and order creation
class UserCreatedEvent extends DomainEvent<{
  userName: string;
  email: string;
}> {}

// Subscribe to the UserCreated event and send a welcome email
eventDispatcher.subscribe(UserCreatedEvent, (event) => {
  console.log(
    `User created - Name: ${event.data.userName}, Email: ${event.data.email}`
  );
  emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(event.data.email);
});

// Simulate a user being created
const newUserEvent = new UserCreatedEvent({
  userName: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
});
eventDispatcher.publish(newUserEvent);
```
